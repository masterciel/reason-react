> **Obsolete ReasonML / BuckleScript bindings for React.js**

Due to our rebranding from BuckleScript + Reason to ReScript, this binding was deprecated in favour of [@rescript/react](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-react) .
 
Read our [latest blog post](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog/2021/05/07/rescript-migration) for more details.

We will keep the old [reason-react website](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/) online for existing users, but we won't accept any patches / updates.
