You can try ReasonReact, with live JS output, in the [Reason Try page](https://reasonml.github.io/en/try.html?rrjsx=true&reason=LYewJgrgNgpgBAcQE4xgFwJYDsDmcC8cA3gFBxyxpwDGIwADiFjFlYQEowCGAzk512poAdDzRc0MWDx4BhOo2asAFACJkqTLlUBKANxkK6OMC4BreIQD61ABYYoYFFgIA+YofLDvtBkxZoADSecM5gMEgAXHA8UgBmbiHkADwARhBoaEzuygJ8WAJComhI2DgAKiAAorDAAWoAElJQIACEujpwyQD06ZnZweQAvgYjJCSFaAAiAPIAspzCYRGVNTB1rADqGGi2AJJgyska6GVw3a6BcKr0KABuGDAA7rp6QA). The template's in the Examples menu.

You can also try it on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/reactre). Just hit run button to start the development server and from there you can edit and see it live. Any web app you build is live-deployed and the URL will be available forever.
